# Geometry of Prism Pair

![Prism Pair Geometry](PrismPair_geometry.svg){#fig-prism-pair-geometry}

@fig-prism-pair-geometry shows the geometry of a prism pair. 
Set the apex of the first prism ($O_1$) as the origin of the coordinate system.
And the base is parallel to the $x$-axis of the coordinate system.
The second prism apex ($O_2$) is located at $(W, -H)$ ($H>0,\, W>0$).
And for convenience, the unit vectors $\boldsymbol{u}_1$ and $\boldsymbol{u}_2$ are defined as shown in @fig-prism-pair-geometry.
The apex angle of the prism is $\alpha$, and the refractive index is $n$.
Both base of the prisms are parallel to each other.
The incident angle and the refraction angle at the first surface of the prism (at Point A) are $\theta_0$ and $\theta_1$,
respectively.
The refraction angles at the second surface (at Point B) are $\theta_2$ and $\theta_3$.
On the second prism, the refraction angles at Point C are $\theta_4$ and $\theta_5$, and 
at Point D are $\theta_6$ and $\theta_7$.
The angles are related by Snell's law.

The GDD is described as follows:
\begin{equation}
GDD = \frac{\lambda^3}{2 \pi c^2} \frac{d^2 }{d \lambda^2} \left[n(\lambda) (P_{AB}+ P_{CD})+ P_{BC}\right]
\label{eq:gdd}
\end{equation}
where, $P_{AB}$ is the path length in the first prism, $P_{CD}$ is the path length in the second prism, and $P_{BC}$ is the path length in the air between the two prisms.
The ray is incident on the first prism at point A, and exits from the second prism at point D.
The path $P_{O_1A}$ and $P_{O_2C}$ are the input parameters.

Further, the incident angle $\theta_0$ is also the input parameter.

And the distance between the two prisms $W$ and $H$ are also the input parameters.
(Or other quantity that describes the distance between the two prisms may be appropriate.)

$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{O_1 O_2} &= \sqrt{W^2 + H^2}\\
\end{aligned}
$$



$$
\begin{aligned}
\theta_1 + \theta_2 &= \alpha \\
\theta_3 &= \theta_4 \\
\theta_2 &= \theta_5 \\
\theta_1 &= \theta_6 \\
\theta_0 &= \theta_7 
\end{aligned}
$$

# Physical distance between A and B (In the prism)

As $P_{AB} \cos \theta_2 = P_{O_1A} \sin \alpha$,
\begin{equation}
P_{AB} = P_{O_1 A} \frac{  \sin \alpha}{ \cos\theta_2}
\end{equation}



$P_{O_1 B}$ is the length between the apex and the exit point of the ray in the first prism. 
As, $P_{O_1 B} = P_{O_1 A} \cos \alpha + P_{AB} \sin \theta_2$, thus

$P_{O_1B} = P_{O_1A}\frac{\cos \theta_1}{\cos \theta_2}$ 


# Physical distance between C and D (In the prism)

Likewise, $P_{CD}$ can be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
P_{CD} = P_{O_2 C} \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \theta_6} = P_{O_2 C} \frac{\sin \alpha}{\cos \theta_1}
\end{equation}

$P_{O_2C}$ does not depend on the wavelength, $\theta_1$ depends on lambda.

# Physical distance between B and C (In air)

The projection of $BC$ to $\boldsymbol{u}_2$ is same as the projection of $O_1 O_2$ to $\boldsymbol{u}_2$.
The length is $s$ (The gap distance between the prism pair along $\boldsymbol{u}_2$).

$\boldsymbol{u}_0  = (\cos \alpha/2, \sin \alpha /2)$
and
$O_1 O_2 = (W, -H)$, 

Thus, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{BC} \cos \theta_3 = \boldsymbol{u}_2 \cdot O_1 O_2 = W \cos (\alpha/2) - H \sin (\alpha/2)
\end{aligned}
$$

\begin{equation}
P_{BC} = \frac{W \cos (\alpha/2) - H \sin (\alpha/2)}{\cos \theta_3}
\end{equation}


# A problem.

As W and H which deteremines the distance between the two prisms, $P_{O_1 A}$ and $P_{O_2 C}$ which are the length between the incident point of each prism, are input parameters,
and they can be measured directly.  $\alpha$ is given. $n(\lambda)$ is calculable. Thus, to calculate Eq. \eqref{eq:gdd}, it seems to be completely straight forward.
However, there is a problem here.

$W$, $H$, $P_{O_1 A}$ and $P_{O_2 C}$  are not independent.

One way to overcome this difficulty is taking $O_1 O_2$ instead of $W$ and $H$. However, square root appears in the expression, and it is not convenient.
Thus, the other way is taken: the projection $O_1 O_2$ along $\boldsymbol{u}_1 = (\cos \alpha/2, -\sin \alpha/2)$:

\begin{equation}
L \equiv O_1 O_2 \cdot \boldsymbol{u}_1 = W \cos (\alpha/2) + H \sin (\alpha/2).
\end{equation}
While the length $L$ is not so easy to measure dWhile the length $L$ is not so easy to measure directly,
it is free from the problem mentioned above, and its quantity is similar size of the apex distance of the prism.

Thus, the problem is by using $L$, and $P_{O_1 A}$ and $P_{O_2 C}$ as input parameters, how to determine $W$ and $H$.
Once, the $W$ and $H$ are determined, as $\theta_3$ can be determined, and then $P_{BC}$ can be calculated.
Note that we do not need to take into account the material dispersion to determine $W$ and $H$ from $L$ and $P_{O_1}$ and $P_{O_2}$.

# Determine Position B and C.



$B = ( P_{O_1B} \sin (\alpha/2), -P_{O_1B} \cos (\alpha/2) )$


Likewise, the coordinate for the position C is:
$C = (W - P_{O_2C} \sin (\alpha/2), -H + P_{O_2C} \cos (\alpha/2) )$

From the slope of line BC, we can determine the angle $\theta_3$ as follows:
$\tan (-\theta_3 +\alpha/2) = \frac{ -H + P_{O_2C} \cos (\alpha/2) + P_{O_1B} \cos (\alpha/2) }{ W - P_{O_2C} \sin (\alpha/2) - P_{O_1B} \sin (\alpha/2)  }$
